AB  - Summary To investigate the mechanisms behind psychopathologies that are the result of a myriad of genes, cells, neuronal circuits and their way of communicating with each other, animal models that resemble one core aspect or core symptom of a given disorder are required. Therefore, we focused on anxiety, namely anxiety-related behaviors, a core symptom of anxiety disorders. Every animal exhibits anxiety, as it is an essential part of evolution and an individual's decision of ?fight or flight? in a given situation might be the last decision it ever takes. Our HAB/LAB mouse and rat models of inborn trait anxiety focused on the following points, first to breed the animals with selection pressure exerted on extremely high vs. extremely low anxiety, then to genetically fix this trait by inbreeding. Following this, we could start to examine what lies behind the respective behavior, what kind of behaviors are associated with it and next, which brain circuitries, molecules, genes and gene products differ between our animal lines to bring about this inborn behavior. Finally, we investigated the impact of environmental factors on genetically (seemingly) rigid anxiety-related behaviors in order to evaluate gene-environment interactions, which brought us from gene analyses to the study of epigenetic mechanisms related to the regulation of anxiety.

AB  - Abstract Many studies on stem cell plasticity are challenging the concept that stem cells contain an intrinsically predefined, unidirectional differentiation program. This means that the developmental fate of a stem cell is dependent on the general potential of the cell (pre-determined stem cell fate) as well as on microenvironmental cues, such as stimuli from growth factors (stem cell niche). Here, we reviewed reports that examined the hepatocyte differentiation ability of stem cells from two different sources: embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells. All of those stem cells revealed the ability to give rise to hepatocyte-like cells using different induction strategies. However, it is still not clear which of those stem cells would be the best source for hepatocyte replacement or which would be the best protocol. We herein present the current knowledge regarding available protocols and factors used in order to obtain functional hepatocytes from stem cells.

AB  - Summary This chapter reviews the prevailing methods and achievements in bioinformatics and systems biology that have driven research in systems nutrition (SN). Gene set analysis (GSA) has arguably become the most widely adopted method for high-throughput gene expression (i.e. transcriptomic) analysis. The common goal of any GSA algorithm is to identify coordinated changes in sets of functionally cohesive genes. Multivariate analysis incorporates a range of approaches for exploring the structure within and between multivariate datasets. A common underlying theme across many multivariate techniques is dimensionality reduction that is, identifying informative low-dimensional representations of high-dimensional datasets. Data analysis and influence/association network inference are mainly based on the correlation of observed quantities and on the localisation into subsystems (tissue, organ, subcellular compartment) of the relevant events. The chapter mentions some of the most used databases, connecting them with the main methods.

AB  - Abstract With an increase in the ageing population worldwide, the prevalence of osteoporosis increases at an alarming rate in both male and female irrespective of their ethnicity. At present, the currently available therapeutic options are mostly limited to either bone resorptive or bone forming efficacies and both approaches are associated with serious side effects. Despite these options, there is still need for newer therapeutics to treat osteoporosis, which can offer beneficial effects for maintaining balanced dynamics between bone formation and bone resorption, devoid of any side effect. The proper understanding of pathophysiology of the disease is essential for designing or investigating an effective and safe anti-osteoporotic agent. This review represents a discussion around the molecular targets with their implications in disease progression, available therapeutic options, the emerging targets, and the importance of designing an effective anti-osteoporotic agent.

AB  - Abstract Creatine transporter deficiency was discovered in 2001 as an X-linked cause of intellectual disability characterized by cerebral creatine deficiency. This review describes the current knowledge regarding creatine metabolism, the creatine transporter and the clinical aspects of creatine transporter deficiency. The condition mainly affects the brain while other creatine requiring organs, such as the muscles, are relatively spared. Recent studies have provided strong evidence that creatine synthesis also occurs in the brain, leading to the intriguing question of why cerebral creatine is deficient in creatine transporter deficiency. The possible mechanisms explaining the cerebral creatine deficiency are discussed. The creatine transporter knockout mouse provides a good model to study the disease. Over the past years several treatment options have been explored but no treatment has been proven effective. Understanding the pathogenesis of creatine transporter deficiency is of paramount importance in the development of an effective treatment.

AB  - Summary Most infants born to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected women escape HIV infection. Infants evade infection despite an immature immune system and, in the case of breastfeeding, prolonged repetitive exposure. If infants become infected, the course of their infection and response to treatment differs dramatically depending upon the timing (in utero, intrapartum, or during breastfeeding) and potentially the route of their infection. Perinatally acquired HIV infection occurs during a critical window of immune development. HIV's perturbation of this dynamic process may account for the striking age-dependent differences in HIV disease progression. HIV infection also profoundly disrupts the maternal immune system upon which infants rely for protection and immune instruction. Therefore, it is not surprising that infants who escape HIV infection still suffer adverse effects. In this review, we highlight the unique aspects of pediatric HIV transmission and pathogenesis with a focus on mechanisms by which HIV infection during immune ontogeny may allow discovery of key elements for protection and control from HIV.

AB  - J. Neurochem. (2011) 117, 221?230. Abstract The trigeminal ganglion is the largest of the cranial ganglia and responsible for transmitting sensory information for much of the face. The cell surface glycoprotein CD151 is an early marker of the trigeminal placode, the precursor to the ganglion. Here, we investigate the role of CD151 during specification of trigeminal placode cells in the developing chicken embryo. Expression of the transcription factor Pax3, the earliest known marker of the trigeminal placode, briefly precedes that of CD151, but they then subsequently overlap in the trigeminal placode. Loss of CD151 protein dramatically decreases the number of Pax3+ placode cells in Stage 13?14 embryos, leading to loss of ophthalmic trigeminal neurons by Stages 16 and 17. Although the initial size of the Pax3 population is similar to that in controls, the number of Pax3+ cells decreases with time without alterations in cell death or proliferation. This suggests a role for CD151 in maintenance of the specification state in the trigeminal placode, uncovering the first known role for a tetraspanin in a developmental system.
