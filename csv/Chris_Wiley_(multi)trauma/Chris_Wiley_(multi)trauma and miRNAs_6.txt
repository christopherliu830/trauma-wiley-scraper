AB  - Although originally described as a highly conserved nuclear protein involved in DNA replication, transcription and repair, high-mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB1) has emerged as a key mediator in the regulation of immune responses to infection and sterile injury by exhibiting all the properties of a prototypic ?alarmin?. These include rapid passive release in response to pathogenic infection and/or traumatic injury, active secretion providing for chemotactic and cytokine-like function and an ability to resolve inflammation, including tissue repair and remodelling. In this review, we will give an overview of the post-translational modifications necessary for such diversity in biological activity, concentrating particularly on how differences in oxidation of highly conserved redox-sensitive cysteine residues can potentiate inflammatory responses and dictate cellular fate. We will also review the most recent literature on HMGB1 and its involvement in the pathophysiology of sepsis and cancer, as well as cancer therapy-induced mucositis.

AB  - Abstract Cartilage has limited repair and regeneration capacity, thus damage of cartilage often results in its dysfunction and even chronic diseases like osteoarthritis (OA). Chondrogenesis induced by tissue-engineering methods is essential to treating cartilage-related diseases. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding single-stranded RNAs which exert their biological effects by binding to the target messenger RNAs (mRNAs), resulting in decay or translation suppression of target mRNAs. There are emerging evidence indicating that miRNAs may play important roles in regulating both prenatal and postnatal chondrogenesis. During embryonic skeletal development, prenatal chondrogenesis is thought to be a precondition for formation of cartilage in developing limbs. Plenty of studies on different types of stem cells have undoubtedly proven their capacity of differentiating into chondrocytes. MiRNAs are found to comprehensively modulate these processes by establishing an interaction network with target genes, transcription factors and cytokines et al. In addition, translational application of miRNA technology has also been explored. In this review, we focus on the up-dated progress on regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs in prenatal and postnatal chondrogenesis. In addition, several miRNA target genes and roles of miRNAs in cartilage-related diseases are also discussed. This will contribute to studies of chondrogenesis mechanisms and development of new treating methods.

AB  - Abstract Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are adult multipotent cells that due to their ability to homing to damaged tissues and differentiate into specialized cells, are remarkable cells in the field of regenerative medicine. It's suggested that the predominant mechanism of MSCs in tissue repair might be related to their paracrine activity. The utilization of MSCs for tissue repair is initially based on the differentiation ability of these cells; however now it has been revealed that only a small fraction of the transplanted MSCs actually fuse and survive in host tissues. Indeed, MSCs supply the microenvironment with the secretion of soluble trophic factors, survival signals and the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) such as exosome. Also, the paracrine activity of EVs could mediate the cellular communication to induce cell-differentiation/self-renewal. Recent findings suggest that EVs released by MSCs may also be critical in the physiological function of these cells. This review provides an overview of MSC-derived extracellular vesicles as a hopeful opportunity to advance novel cell-free therapy strategies that might prevail over the obstacles and risks associated with the use of native or engineered stem cells. EVs are very stable; they can pass the biological barriers without rejection and can shuttle bioactive molecules from one cell to another, causing the exchange of genetic information and reprogramming of the recipient cells. Moreover, extracellular vesicles may provide therapeutic cargo for a wide range of diseases and cancer therapy.

AB  - Abstract Acute lung injury (ALI) caused by sepsis occurs early and the condition is severe, and is also an important reason for accelerating the death of patients. Increasing evidence has identified long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) metastasis associated in lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) as a regulator of ALI. However, the potential mechanism underlying MALAT1 on ALI still needs further identification. To explore the mechanisms of gene regulation expression mediated by MALAT1 through miR-149/MyD88 in lung injury inflammation, we constructed a lung injury inflammatory model using the lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced method and quantificated the cytokines and signaling cascade molecules as well as miR-149. The MALAT1, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1? (IL-1?), and IL-6 levels were significantly increased, and the nuclear factor-?B (NF-?B) pathway was activated, but the miR-149 level was decreased in the LPS-induced ALI model. miR-149 directly targeted both lncRNA MALAT1 and the MyD88 gene. Knockdown of MALAT1 down-regulated the levels of MyD88, TNF-α, IL-1?, and IL-6, and inhibited the NF-?B pathway. However, MALAT1 knockdown up-regulated the expression of miR-149. Overexpression of miR-149 down-regulated MyD88, TNF-α, IL-1?, and IL-6 levels, and inhibited the NF-?B pathway. MALAT1 acts as a pro-inflammatory factor in ALI via the miR-149/MyD88/NF-?B axis and is therefore a potential novel therapeutic target for ALI treatment.
