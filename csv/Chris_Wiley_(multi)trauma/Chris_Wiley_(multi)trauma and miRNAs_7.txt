AB  - Summary The paramount aim of predictive toxicology in drug discovery and development is to assess the safety of drugs for use in humans. This chapter presents drug induced kidney injury as an example to illustrate the value and limitations of novel biomarkers by providing an overview of their (patho) physiological role and mechanistic link to toxicity, performance in experimental toxicity studies, approval by regulatory bodies, and application to preclinical decision making. Traditional markers of renal function such as serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) are inherently insensitive as they indicate kidney injury only when large amounts of the renal epithelium have been lost. The most widely studied urinary kidney biomarker is kidney injury molecule- 1 (KIM-1) encoded by the gene Havr1 (hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 1). Advances in science and technology (e.g., microRNAs, next-generation sequencing) may also offer unique opportunities for the discovery of predictive biomarkers.

AB  - Abstract It is well known that neurogenesis is not the only concern for the fully functional recovery after brain or spinal cord injury, as it has been shed light on the critical role of angiogenesis in improving neurological functional recovery. Angiogenesis and neurogenesis coordinately interact with each other in the developing and adult brain, during which they may respond to similar mediators and receptors, in which they share a common posttranscriptional regulator: the miR-17?92 cluster. The miR-17?92 cluster was initially described as an oncogene and was later demonstrated to drive key physiological and pathological responses during development and diseases respectively. It has been reported that the miR-17?92 cluster regulates both neurogenesis and angiogenesis. The miR-17?92 cluster modulates neural progenitor cells proliferation not only during development but also during neurological disorders such as stroke. It has also been shown that the endothelial miR-17?92 cluster regulates angiogenesis during embryonic stage and adulthood. In this review, we have discussed the actions of the miR-17?92 cluster in neuronal and vascular plasticity, and its potential as a novel therapeutic strategy for CNS injury. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Summary The discovery, analysis, and validation of any biomarker, including nucleic acid-based biomarkers remains a challenging task. This chapter focuses on the three most prominent urologic malignancies: bladder cancer, prostate cancer, and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). For every tumor entity, it provides an overview of the hereditary tumor syndromes and the underlying genetic aberrations followed by biomarkers in the setting of sporadic tumor disease. Three prognostic groups were defined within a cohort of 150 cystectomy patients: patients with abnormal findings in both assays had the worst prognosis, those with normal findings in both assays had the best prognosis, and those with one abnormal and one normal finding had an intermediate probability of recurrence and survival. There are several pathways that are important for prostate cancer tumorigenesis and progression, especially the PTEN, c-Myc, and Erg pathways, and therefore a combination of biomarkers in all three pathways may have the greatest impact.
