AB  - Abstract Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a cancer predisposition syndrome that causes early-onset polyposis and is associated with an increased risk for hepatoblastoma. There is currently a lack of consensus on when to order APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) gene testing or implement surveillance for hepatoblastoma. An online questionnaire was completed by 62 genetic counselors to capture their current practices regarding these questions. Extracolonic findings associated with FAP that were most likely to prompt APC testing in an otherwise asymptomatic 10 year-old child with a negative family history were multiple desmoid tumors, congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE), jaw osteomas, and hepatoblastoma. For hepatoblastoma screening, the majority did recommend this in children less than age five years with known APC mutations. An interval of every 3?6 months was most commonly suggested; however, responses extended to screening on a less than annual basis. These results highlight the need for further investigation into why some genetic counselors do not recommend APC testing in young at-risk children and what factors influence views about the ideal age and indication for APC testing. Studies of these issues would help to define the best clinical practice model for genetic testing and hepatoblastoma screening in pediatric patients with FAP.

AB  - Summary.? Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the major cause of liver disease in haemophilia. Few data exist on the proportion with liver fibrosis in this group after long-term HCV and HIV co-infection. We conducted a cross-sectional multi-centre study to determine the impact of HIV on the prevalence and risk factors for fibrosis in haemophilic men with chronic hepatitis C. Biopsies were independently scored by Ishak, Metavir and Knodell systems. Variables were tested for associations with fibrosis using logistic regression and receiver operating curves (ROC). Of 220 biopsied HCV(+) men, 23.6% had Metavir ≥F3 fibrosis, with higher mean Metavir fibrosis scores among HIV/HCV co-infected than HCV mono-infected, 1.6 vs. 1.3 (P?=?0.044). Variables significantly associated with fibrosis included AST, ALT, APRI score (AST/ULN ??100/platelet???109/L), alpha-fetoprotein (all P <?0.0001), platelets (P?= 0.0003) and ferritin (P?=?0.0008). In multiple logistic regression of serum markers, alpha-fetoprotein, APRI and ALT were significantly associated with ≥F3 fibrosis [AUROC?=?0.77 (95% CI 0.69, 0.86)]. Alpha-fetoprotein, APRI and ferritin were significant in HIV(?) [AUROC?=?0.82 (95% CI 0.72, 0.92)], and alpha-fetoprotein and platelets in HIV(+) [AUROC?=?0.77 (95% CI 0.65, 0.88]. In a multivariable model of demographic and clinical variables, transformed (natural logarithm) of alpha-fetoprotein (P?=?0.0003), age (P?=?0.006) and HCV treatment (P?=?0.027) were significantly associated with fibrosis. Nearly one-fourth of haemophilic men have Metavir ≥3 fibrosis. The odds for developing fibrosis are increased in those with elevated alpha-fetoprotein, increasing age and past HCV treatment.

AB  - Abstract The influence of hepatitis B virus infection, alcohol consumption, tobacco smoking and use of oral contraceptives on the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was evaluated in a hospital-based case-control study in Catalonia, in the Mediterranean coastal area of north-eastern Spain. A total of 96 HCC cases (86.5% of them with associated liver cirrhosis) and 190 age- and sex-matched controls were studied. The odds ratio of HCC and 95% confidence interval among hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriers was 4.9 (1.3-21.9). The OR was not significantly elevated in smokers, and a marginally significant increased risk was found among users of oral contraceptives based on 6 female cases. There was a significant dose-response relationship between alcohol consumption and risk of HCC (X2 for trend: 24.3, p < 0.001). Although hepatitis B infection was strongly associated with HCC, alcohol abuse leading to cirrhosis appears to be one of the main causes of HCC in this region.

AB  - Summary Background Portal hypertension and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are major complications of advanced liver cirrhosis. Thus, patients are often affected by both complications. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPSS) is an effective treatment for portal hypertension and its complications. However, no established guidelines for the treatment of symptomatic portal hypertension in HCC patients are currently available. In addition, only limited information exists about the consequence of TIPSS implantation in patients with HCC. Aim To evaluate the efficacy, safety and overall survival in HCC patients who underwent TIPSS implantation. Methods Forty HCC patients with portal hypertension who were treated with TIPSS between 1995 and 2012 were included in the analysis. Medical records and imaging studies were analysed. The indication for TIPSS implantation, procedure-related complications, treatment success and overall survival were assessed. Results TIPSS implantation was performed in 23 patients (57.5%) due to treatment refractory ascites, in 14 patients (35.0%) due to recurrent variceal bleeding and in three patients (7.5%) due to ascites and variceal bleeding. Primary technical success was assessed in all patients. After TIPSS implantation, no variceal bleeding reoccurred and ascites was controlled in 74.1%. No severe procedure-related complications and no deterioration of liver function were observed. Post-TIPSS hepatic encephalopathy occurred in 40.0% of all patients. 30-day, 90-day-, 1-year- and 5-year survival rates were 97.5%, 75.0%, 42.5% and 7.5%, respectively. Median overall survival after TIPSS implantation was 180 days. Conclusion Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt implantation is an effective and safe treatment for portal hypertension in patients with HCC.

AB  - Summary Recent major technological advances in Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) have enabled the accurate, noninvasive detection and characterization of hepatic lesions. Due to its relative lower cost, availability and widespread distribution, CT is often the primary imaging modality in the initial evaluation of the liver. However, with comparatively superior lesion-to-liver contrast, ability to utilize hepatocyte-specific contrast agents, and lack of ionizing radiation, MRI is realizing an increasingly greater role in this regard. For assessment of the gallbladder and biliary system, ultrasound (US) remains a basic modality for the prompt diagnosis of stones and acute inflammatory or obstructing processes. Advanced CT & MR techniques are utilized for evaluating equivocal US findings, oncologic staging, preoperative planning and post-operative complications. This chapter reviews the discriminating imaging features of commonly encountered hepatobiliary pathology at cross-sectional imaging.

AB  - Abstract Development of a multicellular organism is accomplished through a series of events that are preprogrammed in the genome. These events encompass cellular proliferation, lineage commitment, lineage progression, lineage expression, cellular inhibition, and regulated apoptosis. The sequential progression of cells through these events results in the formation of the differentiated cells, tissues, and organs that constitute an individual. Although most cells progress through this sequence during development, a few cells leave the developmental continuum to become reserve precursor cells. The reserve precursor cells are involved in the continual maintenance and repair of the tissues and organs throughout the life span of the individual. Until recently it was generally assumed that the precursor cells in postnatal individuals were limited to lineage-committed progenitor cells specific for various tissues. However, studies by Young, his colleagues, and others have demonstrated the presence of two categories of precursor cells that reside within the organs and tissues of postnatal animals. These two categories of precursor cells are lineage-committed (multipotent, tripotent, bipotent, and unipotent) progenitor cells and lineage-uncommitted pluripotent (epiblastic-like, ectodermal, mesodermal, and endodermal) stem cells. These reserve precursor cells provide for the continual maintenance and repair of the organism after birth. Anat Rec Part A 276A:75?102, 2004. ? 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Abstract Rationale, Aims and Objectives? We sought to use a novel case-selection methodology to identify antenatal or intrapartum risk factors associated with neonatal neurological impairment following non-reassuring fetal heart rate patterns during labour. Method? We used a retrospective case?control design with bivariate and multivariate conditional logistic regression. Cases were births in which electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) showed non-reassuring patterns and the infant had neurological disability. Controls were births in which EFM was non-reassuring but the infant was born healthy. We identified 36 cases from among malpractice claims filed with a liability insurer in Massachusetts between 1985 and 2001 and randomly selected 70 controls, matching them to cases by hospital, birth date and gestational age. Results? More cases had maternal antenatal vaginal bleeding (P?=?0.004), a prolonged latent phase or protracted dilation during the first stage of labour (P?=?0.03), and protracted descent or prolonged second stage (P?=?0.01). More cases also had minimal variability on EFM on admission (P?=?0.02) and during the second stage (P?=?0.02). Multivariate analysis highlighted three significant predictors of neurological injury following complicated labour: antenatal vaginal bleeding (OR?=?27.1), prolonged latent phase or protracted dilation in the first stage (OR?=?4.0) and EFM showing minimal variability in the first stage (OR?=?4.3). Conclusion? These promising initial findings suggest that future research into outcomes from complicated labour with non-reassuring heart rate patterns should focus on maternal history of vaginal bleeding, slow labour and minimal variability on EFM.

AB  - Summary This review summarises evidence for immunomodulatory effect of drugs administered peri-operatively. The clinical significance of the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines may be seen in certain disease states, for example, meningococcal meningitis and Lyme arthritis. This balance may be altered peri-operatively. Traditionally, these changes are considered to be due to the stress response of surgery, the response to cardiopulmonary bypass, or endotoxaemia. This review presents in vitro evidence suggesting that drugs modulating this cytokine balance include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, phosphodiesterase inhibitors and opioids, acting through effects on intracellular cyclic nucleotide messenger systems. An important consequence of the pro-inflammatory cytokine activity is increased adhesion of neutrophils. Aspects of this process may be inhibited by avoiding low blood flow states, by reducing adhesion molecule expression (for example by use of pentoxifylline), or by use of negatively charged anions such as heparin. Neutrophil activity is generally depressed by intravenous anaesthetic induction agents, but is enhanced by opioids. Natural killer cell activity, which is involved in immunity against tumour cells and virally infected cells is transiently depressed by volatile anaesthetic agents and opioids. In contrast catecholamines enhance natural killer cell activity. Whereas decrease in immunoglobulin levels occur peri-operatively, this is not thought to be as a result of drugs at clinically used concentrations but rather due to haemodilution.

AB  - Abstract Among the variety of transducer concepts proposed for label-free detection of biomolecules, the semiconductor field-effect device (FED) is one of the most attractive platforms. As medical techniques continue to progress towards diagnostic and therapies based on biomarkers, the ability of FEDs for a label-free, fast and real-time detection of multiple pathogenic and physiologically relevant molecules with high specificity and sensitivity offers very promising prospects for their application in point-of-care and personalized medicine for an early diagnosis and treatment of diseases. The presented paper reviews recent advances and current trends in research and development of different FEDs for label-free, direct electrical detection of charged biomolecules by their intrinsic molecular charge. The authors are mainly focusing on the detection of the DNA hybridization event, antibody-antigen affinity reaction as well as clinically relevant biomolecules such as cardiac and cancer biomarkers.

AB  - Abstract XXYY syndrome occurs in approximately 1:18,000?1:40,000 males. Although the physical phenotype is similar to 47,XXY (tall stature, hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, and infertility), XXYY is associated with additional medical problems and more significant neurodevelopmental and psychological features. We report on the results of a cross-sectional, multi-center study of 95 males age 1?55 with XXYY syndrome (mean age 14.9 years), describing diagnosis, physical features, medical problems, medications, and psychological features stratified by age groups. The mean age of diagnosis was 7.7 years. Developmental delays and behavioral problems were the most common primary indication for genetic testing (68.4%). Physical and facial features varied with age, although hypertelorism, clinodactyly, pes planus, and dental problems were common across all age groups. Tall stature was present in adolescents and adults, with a mean adult stature of 192.4 cm (SD 7.5; n?=?22). Common medical problems included allergies and asthma (>50%), congenital heart defects (19.4%), radioulnar synostosis (17.2%), inguinal hernia and/or cryptorchidism (16.1%), and seizures (15%). Medical features in adulthood included hypogonadism (100%), DVT (18.2%), intention tremor (71%) and type II diabetes (18.2%). Brain MRI (n?=?35) showed white matter abnormalities in 45.7% of patients and enlarged ventricles in 22.8%. Neurodevelopmental and psychological difficulties were a significant component of the behavioral phenotype, with developmental delays and learning disabilities universal but variable in severity. Twenty-six percent had full-scale IQs in the range of intellectual disability (MR), and adaptive functioning was significantly impacted with 68% with adaptive composite scores <70. Rates of neurodevelopmental disorders, including ADHD (72.2%), autism spectrum disorders (28.3%), mood disorders (46.8%), and tic disorders (18.9%), were elevated with 55.9% on psychopharmacologic medication overall. Recommendations for evaluation and treatment are summarized. ? 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
