AB  - Summary This chapter defines palliative care, enumerates the benefits and risks of such care, discusses the standards for palliative treatment, and suggests ways in which palliative care can fit into a typical radiation oncology practice. It focuses primarily on the role that palliative care can play in the care of patients with cancer. It presents a few case vignettes illustrating the diverse types of cancer patients who might be able to benefit from palliative care interventions. The chapter shows National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and many professional organizations, including American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO), published detailed guidelines for pain and symptom management in cancer patients. Further, it provides examples of commonly encountered clinical situations where radiation therapy (RT) can provide symptom palliation and suggests techniques for improving the therapeutic ratio of RT.

AB  - Abstract Teratomas are uncommon neoplasms comprised of mixed dermal elements derived from the three germ cell layers. Historically, teratomas were attributed to demons, sexual misconduct, and abnormal fertilization. They attract attention because of their bizarre histology and gross appearance. While the majority of teratomas present congenitally in the sacrococcygeal region, within the ovaries of adolescent females and within the testes of young men, they have been identified throughout the body. Extragonadal teratomas tend to occur in midline structures as the anterior mediastinum, retroperitoneum, sacrococcygeal region, and pineal gland. Retroperitoneal teratomas represent only 1?11% of primary retroperitoneal tumors. Incidence is bimodal with peaks in the first 6 months of life and in early adulthood. Due to their location, they are usually identified only after they have grown to huge proportions. There is a 25% chance of malignancy. Surgical resection remains the mainstay of therapy and is required for definitive diagnosis. This article reviews the literature on the histopathology, classification, genetic abnormalities, and theories of origin of teratomas as well as the presentation, diagnosis, and management of retroperitoneal teratomas.

AB  - Summary The Pregnancy Outcomes and Community Health (POUCH) Study enrolled women in their 15th to 27th week of pregnancy from 52 prenatal clinics located in five communities. After the study began, an at-home protocol to measure maternal stress was added, which included collection of urine and saliva twice a day (waking?=?AM, bedtime?=?PM) for three consecutive days, and completion of a daily diary. The at-home protocol was in place for 2852 POUCH participants at enrolment, and 81.3% (n?=?2318) consented and returned samples and diary. For these analyses, salivary cortisol was analysed in a subset of 846 women who delivered at term. Day-to-day correlation coefficients for AM cortisol (0.45?0.55) exceeded those for PM cortisol (0.31?0.43). Study diaries indicated that there was variation in the time interval between waking and sample collection. Analyses of discrete intervals showed the same awakening response pattern in cortisol levels that has been reported in studies with serial AM sampling. The adjusted mean AM cortisol (µg/dL) was 0.506 at 0?15?min post-waking, 0.544 at 16?30?min (P?<?0.05), 0.582 at 31?60?min (P?<?0.01), and 0.515 at >60?min post-waking. In addition, adjusted mean AM cortisol in samples collected at or before 9?a.m. was higher than that in samples collected after 9?a.m. (0.564 vs. 0.510?µg/dL, P?<?0.01). Among working women, adjusted mean AM cortisol was higher on work days than non-work days (0.564 vs. 0.489?µg/dL, P?<?0.01), and in multiparae compared with primiparae (0.551 vs. 0.502?µg/dL, P?=?0.07). The parity effect was not evident in non-working women. The adjusted mean PM cortisol significantly increased as week of pregnancy at sampling increased, but was not significantly related to time of collection, work day and parity. Factors influencing AM and PM cortisol levels in pregnancy appear to differ. In studies of AM cortisol levels, it is important to gather data on time of sample collection, interval from waking to sample collection, parity and work.

AB  - Abstract Observations made in the last few years support the existence of pathways, in adult humans and rodents, that allow adult stem cells to be surprisingly flexible in their differentiation repertoires. Termed plasticity, this property allows adult stem cells, assumed, until now, to be committed to generating a fixed range of progeny, to switch, when they have been relocated, to make other specialized sets of cells appropriate to their new niche. Reprogramming of some adult stem cells can occur in vivo; the stem cells normally resident in bone marrow appear particularly flexible and are able to contribute usefully to multiple recipient organs. This process produces cells with specialized structural and metabolic adaptations commensurate with their new locations. In a few examples, the degree of support is sufficient to assist or even rescue recipient mice from genetic defects. Some studies provide evidence for the expansion of the reprogrammed cells locally, but in most it remains possible that cells arrive and redifferentiate, but are no longer stem cells. Nevertheless, the fact that appropriately differentiated cells are delivered deep within organs simply by injection of bone marrow cells should make us think differently about the way that organs regenerate and repair. Migratory pathways for stem cells in adult organisms may exist that could be exploited to effect repairs using an individual's own stem cells, perhaps after gene therapy. Logical extensions of this concept are that a transplanted organ would become affected by the genetic susceptibilities of the recipient, alleles that re-express themselves via marrow-derived stem cells, and that plasticity after bone marrow transplantation would also transfer different phenotypes, affecting important parameters such as susceptibility to long-term complications of diabetes, or the ability to metabolize drugs in the liver. This article reviews some of the evidence for stem cell plasticity in rodents and man. Copyright ? 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The emerging graphene quantum dots (GQDs) and carbon dots (C-dots) have gained tremendous attention for their enormous potentials for biomedical applications, owing to their unique and tunable photoluminescence properties, exceptional physicochemical properties, high photostability, biocompatibility, and small size. This article aims to update the latest results in this rapidly evolving field and to provide critical insights to inspire more exciting developments. We comparatively review the properties and synthesis methods of these carbon nanodots and place emphasis on their biological (both fundamental and theranostic) applications.
