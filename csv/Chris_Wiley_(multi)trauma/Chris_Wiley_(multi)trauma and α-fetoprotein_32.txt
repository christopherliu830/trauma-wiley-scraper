AB  - Summary Nowadays there is a continuous interest in addressing challenges related to the achievement of accurate and reliable monitoring of disease-related biomarkers relevant in the diagnostic process. In this context, biosensors have been developed as analytical tools capable to detect and quantify several analytes, bringing numerous advantages than other conventional techniques. Contrasting to conventional lab tests, which typically take hours or days to provide results to healthcare providers, sensors and biosensors can deliver accurate results in seconds, making them promising analytical devices ideal for medical applications. In the elaboration of biosensors, numerous materials have been studied and applied either as a biorecognition element or as the transducer surface modifier. The excellent electrical conductivity of graphene, besides their chemical, optical, mechanical and structural properties make them as valuable material for use in electrochemical sensors, electronic and optical sensors. The two-dimensional graphene sheets have captured the interest and imagination of physicist and chemists for different functionalization and combinations which can be applied in various biosensors architecture allowing detection with good sensitivity and stability. There are many research groups around the world creating their own unique graphene biosensors schemes and biosensing protocols customized for specific applications. This chapter outlines some fundamentals about structure and properties of graphene and recent literature on sensors and biosensors based on graphene proving practical applications on human fluid samples for medical diagnostics. The functionalization of graphene is comparatively discussed in view of (bio)sensor development.

TI  - Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder: consensus and controversies

AB  - Since the previous publication of Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) guidelines in 1997, there has been a substantial increase in evidence-based treatment options for bipolar disorder. The present guidelines review the new evidence and use criteria to rate strength of evidence and incorporate effectiveness, safety, and tolerability data to determine global clinical recommendations for treatment of various phases of bipolar disorder. The guidelines suggest that although pharmacotherapy forms the cornerstone of management, utilization of adjunctive psychosocial treatments and incorporation of chronic disease management model involving a healthcare team are required in providing optimal management for patients with bipolar disorder. Lithium, valproate and several atypical antipsychotics are first-line treatments for acute mania. Bipolar depression and mixed states are frequently associated with suicidal acts; therefore assessment for suicide should always be an integral part of managing any bipolar patient. Lithium, lamotrigine or various combinations of antidepressant and mood-stabilizing agents are first-line treatments for bipolar depression. First-line options in the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder are lithium, lamotrigine, valproate and olanzapine. Historical and symptom profiles help with treatment selection. With the growing recognition of bipolar II disorders, it is anticipated that a larger body of evidence will become available to guide treatment of this common and disabling condition. These guidelines also discuss issues related to bipolar disorder in women and those with comorbidity and include a section on safety and monitoring.
