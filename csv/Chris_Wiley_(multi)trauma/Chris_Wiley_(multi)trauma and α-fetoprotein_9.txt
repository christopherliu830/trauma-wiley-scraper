AB  - Summary The aim of this chapter is to provide some basic information on the significance, value, and limitations of clinical laboratory safety data for patients participating in drug studies. The intended readership is staff working in clinical drug research, who may be concerned with the selection of laboratories and viewing their laboratory data and reports. It is also the author's wish that the chapter will prove of value to data managers, statisticians, and report writers, as well as clinical research associates and pharmaceutical physicians. Clinical laboratory medicine is a vast and complex discipline and of necessity this chapter is limited to the tests generally considered as ?safety profiles?. I review the pre-analytical factors that can affect clinical laboratory tests, the results of which are subject to analytical and biological variation. I discuss reference ranges, but place greater emphasis on the critical differences in laboratory test results from patient baseline values. I also include basis information on normal and abnormal test results for renal, liver, haematological, and thyroid function, lipid concentrations, and measurements relevant to bones. Finally, I recommend ways in which data from subjects in clinical studies can be interpreted and summarized. It is hoped that the document will answer some of the questions raised by clinical researchers. However, it is important to appreciate that in this specialist discipline experience is invaluable, and so communication with laboratory staff is the preferred route, rather than review of library literature by clinical research staff.

AB  - The 43rd Annual General Meeting of the Urological Society of Australasia was held at the Beaufort Hotel, Darwin, Australia from 27 May to 3 June 1990. The meeting was organised by Mr Peter Maher, President of the Society, and a committee from Sydney. Principal guests of the meeting were Mr R. Hall from Newcastle upon Tyne, England, Professor R. Hartung of the Technische Universität, Munich, Germany, and Professor M. Resnick from Case Western University, Cleveland, USA. The programme featured keynote presentations from principal guests on the topics of laser therapy, stones, bladder outlet obstruction, cancer and paediatrics. The Harry Harris Oration was delivered by Professor Alan Powell, Dean of Arts, North Territory University, on the subject, ?The Australian Aborigines; Past, Present, and the Future?. The Keith Kirkland prize for the best paper presented by a trainee was awarded to Dr M. Frydenberg for his paper on Growth Factor receptors in prostatic disease. The Alban Gee prize for the best poster went to Mr A. Low for his presentation on the Brindley Sacral Root Stimulator. The 44th ASM of the Society will be held at the Sheraton Mirage Hotel, Gold Coast, Queensland, between 14 and 19 April 1991.

AB  - Summary This chapter summaries neurological manifestations of disorders of other body systems and outlines some basic elements of pathophysiology, diagnosis and management. It presents an overview of the range of neurological disease encountered in general medicine. The neurological consequences of aortic or cardiac disorders can be devastating. The chapter considers ischaemic stroke and transient ischaemic attack (TIA) ? the main clinical result of embolism from the heart or great vessel. Thyroid disorders can have a major impact on neurological function; they affect any part of the central nervous system (CNS), peripheral nerves or muscle, mainly via high or low levels of circulating T4 and T3 or immune-mediated damage. It is especially important to recognise neurological manifestations of thyroid disease, as the symptoms will usually respond to appropriate treatment. The chapter summarizes the clinical features of abnormalities in serum sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium.

AB  - Summary This chapter covers the common causes, clinical features, diagnostic evaluation and management of hypothalamo-pituitary disease. The advent of new technologies such as whole exome and whole genome sequencing has resulted in an expanding list of genetic factors involved in human hypothalamo-pituitary disease. The chapter lists examples of genetic factors involved in isolated or multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies. The close proximity of the hypothalamo-pituitary axis to various vital structures means that acquired damage to this area can easily lead to hypopituitarism. The diagnosis of hypopituitarism is based upon a combination of clinical assessment, looking for the presence of not just endocrine-related symptoms and signs but also for other features related to the presence of a congenital syndrome or a suprasellar mass. Confirmation of hypopituitarism is a stepwise process, usually beginning with a baseline pituitary function screen, followed by dynamic pituitary function tests.

AB  - Aim Plasma fibrinogen and D-dimer have been reported to predict survival in several types of malignancies. The aim of this study is to investigate their predictive value in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods We retrospectively analyzed plasma fibrinogen and D-dimer levels from 252 subjects: control (n?=?20), hepatitis (n?=?20), cirrhosis (n?=?20), and HCC (n?=?192) subjects. The clinical involvement and prognostic value of fibrinogen and D-dimer was analyzed in HCC subjects. To confirm the effects of tumor on hypercoagulability and fibrinolysis, fibrinogen and D-dimer levels were measured in nude mice following HCC inoculation. Results Fibrinogen decreased and D-dimer increased in cirrhosis subjects relative to other groups. In HCC subjects, elevated fibrinogen and D-dimer levels were significantly associated with adverse tumor features (increased size, stage, and grade) and systemic inflammation. Patients with HCC with either elevated fibrinogen or D-dimer levels had significantly higher 3-year tumor recurrence rates (65% vs. 41%, P?< 0.001 for fibrinogen; 67% vs. 40%, P?=?0.011 for D-dimer) and significantly lower 3-year overall survival rates (57% vs. 79%, P?< 0.001 for fibrinogen; 56% vs. 80%, P?=?0.001 for D-dimer). After multivariate analysis, elevated fibrinogen levels remained an independent predictor of poor prognosis in HCC patients. Finally, elevated levels of fibrinogen and D-dimer were confirmed in nude mice following tumor inoculation. Conclusion The fibrinogen and D-dimer levels, elevating after carcinogenesis, may serve as simple but effective predictors of adverse tumor profiles and outcomes in HCC.
