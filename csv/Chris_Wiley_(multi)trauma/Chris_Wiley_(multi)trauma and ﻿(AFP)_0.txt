AB  - Abstract Background and Objectives Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) presents in young, otherwise-healthy individuals. This study examined recurrence and survival characteristics after surgical resection for FLC by utilizing an international multi-institutional database. Methods Consecutive patients undergoing hepatectomy for FLC from six institutions (1993?2010) were reviewed retrospectively. Survival was studied with life tables and Cox regression models. Results Thirty-five patients (13 female, 37%) were included (median age: 32 years). R0 resection was achieved in all curative-intent operations (n?=?30), and palliative operations were performed for five patients. Crude 30-day morbidity and mortality rates were 22% and 3%, respectively. For curative-intent surgery, overall and recurrence-free survivals at 5 years were 62% and 45%, respectively. In patients who achieved a 4-year disease-free interval after surgery, none subsequently developed recurrence. In multivariate models, presence of extrahepatic disease was the only factor that independently predicted overall (hazard ratio [HR]: 5.58, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.38?22.55, P?=?0.016) and recurrence-free survival (HR: 5.64, 95% CI: 1.48?21.49, P?=?0.011). Conclusions Patients with surgically amenable FLC had encouraging long-term survival. Recurrence-free survival to 4 years suggested possible freedom from disease thereafter. Recurrent resectable disease was associated with an excellent prognosis, and repeat surgery should be strongly considered. J. Surg. Oncol. 2014; 110:412?415. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Our purpose was to examine the MMPI profiles of 157 patients with chronic headache or facial pain. The following diagnostic groups were considered: tension-type headache (n=44); migraine+cluster headache + chronic paroxysmal hemicrania (20); trigeminal neuralgia (7); atypical facial pain (AFP) (33); temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMJ) (53). There were two control groups: C1 of 27 healthy individuals and C2 of 18 patients with chronic pain located elsewhere. A ?Pain Index? was calculated (0?10) which quantified pattern, duration and frequency of pain. The Italian MMPI abbreviated version was administered to all subjects. One-way Anova, the Duncan test and correlation analysis were performed. Of the diagnostic groups, AFP scored highest and TMJ lowest in all except three scales. In the AFP group, all neurotic scales scored above 70. The Pain Index correlated with higher scores on most scales. Chronic pain may lead to personality alterations, but some features of craniofacial pain correlate with specific personality disturbances.

AB  - Summary Testicular tumors are rare in the pediatric population. Prepubertal testis tumors differ from postpubertal tumors with respect to histopathology and malignant potential, and management therefore differs. The spectrum of testicular tumors occurring in postpubertal boys is similar to that found in adult men; 90% are malignant and are generally managed by radical orchiectomy with or without platinum-based chemotherapy and/or retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. Yolk sac tumor is the most common malignant testis tumor in prepubertal boys and is typically associated with elevated serum α-fetoprotein levels. Teratoma and other stromal tumors, which are almost always benign, account for a majority of prepubertal tumors. The higher likelihood of encountering benign tumors in prepubertal patients makes consideration of testis-sparing surgery important. In postpubertal patients, retroperitoneal lymph node dissection may be required for metastatic disease, and meticulous surgical technique is important to minimize potential complications including bleeding, ejaculatory dysfunction, chylous ascites, and bowel obstruction.

AB  - Summary The discovery in the mid-1970s that maternal serum maternal serum a-fetoprotein (AFP) levels are increased on average in pregnancies affected by fetal neural tube defects (NTDs) ushered in the modern era of antenatal screening. By far the most frequent of these is Down syndrome (DS), with a birth prevalence in the absence of prenatal diagnosis and elective abortion. There is a fundamental difference between screening and diagnostic tests, despite the fact that the same terms are used to describe their results. For chromosomal abnormalities these investigations involve hazardous invasive procedures, chorionic villus sampling (CVS), amniocentesis, and occasionally percutaneous umbilical cord sampling, to obtain material for prenatal diagnosis. Most experience with serum screening for DS is in the second trimester, where it became a natural extension to established AFP screening programs for NTDs, largely at 15-19 weeks? gestation.

Single lung transplantation and fatal fat embolism acquired from the donor: management and literature review.?Clin Transplant 2010: 24: 133?138. ? 2009 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Abstract:? Fat embolism (FE) is a consequence of skeletal trauma that occurs in more than 90% of cases of severe trauma. However, most of these emboli are clinically insignificant. We report the case of a 59-yr-old man with massive progressive fibrosis who died from widespread FE after a single-lung transplantation (SLT). The lung donor was a 22-yr-old woman who died from traumatic cerebral injury. She had sustained a closed fracture of the tibia, fibula and pelvis. The PaO2/FiO2 before procurement was 452?mmHg. A left SLT using cardiopulmonary bypass was performed. In the immediate postoperative period, profound pulmonary edema in the transplanted lung developed, with overinflation of the native lung and systemic hypotension. Severe Primary Graft Dysfunction (PGD) was suspected and nitric oxide (NO) and independent lung ventilation (ILV) initiated. Over the next 24?h the patient?s condition deteriorated and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was initiated. The patient died 45?h after transplantation as cardiovascular and respiratory function continued to decline and massive thoracic bleeding secondary to coagulopathy appeared. Post-mortem examination revealed both massive FE in the non-transplanted donor lung and in the allograft lung. Only two previous cases of donor-acquired FE and PGD after lung transplantation (LT) have been reported. Occult pulmonary FE in a traumatized donor should be considered a cause of PGD.

AB  - Background and Objectives Spontaneous rupture of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (srHCC) is a life-threatening emergency. We sought to identify the pre-operative predictors of early tumor recurrence/mortality including the role of inflammatory indices after partial hepatectomy for srHCC. Methods Between 2000-2015, 79 patients with srHCC were identified to have undergone upfront partial hepatectomy following srHCC. Clinicopathologic data were retrospectively analyzed to identify pre-operative predictors of early (<1 year) recurrence and mortality. Results Seventy-nine patients were identified to have undergone partial hepatectomy for srHCC. The 1-year mortality and 1-year recurrence rate in our series was 30.3% and 41.8% respectively. On multivariate analyses, free tumor rupture and a tumor size?>?10?cm were identified to be independent predictors of early recurrence while an alpha fetoprotein (AFP)?>?200?ng/mL was an independent predictor of early mortality. Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio?>?3 and prognostic nutritional index?<?40 were predictors of early recurrence while PLR?>?180 was a predictor of early mortality on univariate analyses but not multivariate analyses. Conclusions Tumor size?>?10?cm, free tumor rupture, and an AFP?>?200?ng/mL were useful predictors in avoiding ?futile surgery? in patients with srHCC undergoing a partial hepatectomy. Preoperative inflammatory markers appear to be less useful as predictors of early recurrence/mortality in this cohort of patients.

AB  - Abstract Background The image-guided operating room (OR) is an emerging standard for dealing with complex cases in many surgical disciplines including neurosurgery, thoracic surgery, maxillofacial trauma, and orthopedic surgery. Its use in head and neck oncological surgery is not well established. The primary aim of this study was to assess the image quality of cone-beam CT (CBCT) under real clinical conditions. The secondary aim was to assess the effect on surgical performance and decision making. Methods Intraoperative 3D imaging was performed using a CBCT capable C-Arm mounted on a multi-axis robot (Siemens Zeego) in the image-guided OR. All patients had immediate preoperative imaging taken with further intraoperative imaging performed as required. Ten initial patients, comprising 28 intraoperative scans, were used for questionnaire-based image reviews conducted with experienced head and neck clinicians. Scans were assessed for aspects of both image quality and clinical utility, on separate 5-point Likert scales (1-5). Results The median rating for bony detail was 4 out of 5. Vascular detail was increased (P < 10?8) from 1 to 3 with the use of IV contrast (region of interest CT# was 284 HU [SD, 47 HU]). Images were rated as 4 for freedom from artifact. Soft tissue definition was 2, with no significant improvement (P =?.2) with the addition of IV iodinated contrast. Surgeons rated the greatest clinical utility (4) for the CBCT when assessing postreconstruction imaging of a complex case. Conclusions The image quality of CBCT in the image-guided OR is good for bony detail and complex oncological reconstructions in the head and neck setting but probably has limited benefit for intraoperative soft tissue delineation. Future studies must also focus on clinical outcomes to help demonstrate the value of the image-guided OR.

AB  - The impact of ischemia/reperfusion injury in the setting of transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been thoroughly investigated. The present study examined data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients for all recipients of deceased donor liver transplants performed between January 1, 1995 and October 31, 2011. In a multivariate Cox analysis, significant predictors of patient survival included the following: HCC diagnosis (P < 0.01), donation after cardiac death (DCD) allograft (P < 0.001), hepatitis C virus-positive status (P < 0.01), recipient age (P < 0.01), donor age (P < 0.001), Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score (P < 0.001), recipient race, and an alpha-fetoprotein level > 400 ng/mL at the time of transplantation. In order to test whether the decreased survival seen for HCC recipients of DCD grafts was more than would be expected because of the inferior nature of DCD grafts and the diagnosis of HCC, a DCD allograft/HCC diagnosis interaction term was created to look for potentiation of effect. In a multivariate analysis adjusted for all other covariates, this interaction term was statistically significant (P = 0.049) and confirmed that there was potentiation of inferior survival with the use of DCD allografts in recipients with HCC. In conclusion, patient survival and graft survival were inferior for HCC recipients of DCD allografts versus recipients of donation after brain death allografts. This potentiation of effect of inferior survival remained even after adjustments for the inherent inferiority observed in DCD allografts as well as other known risk factors. It is hypothesized that this difference could reflect an increased rate of recurrence of HCC. Liver Transpl 19:1214?1223, 2013. ? 2013 AASLD.

AB  - Abstract The functional significance of changes in nuclear structure and organization in transformed cells remains one of the most enigmatic questions in cancer biology. In this review, we discuss relationships between nuclear organization and transcription in terms of the three-dimensional arrangement of genes in the interphase cancer nucleus and the regulatory functions of nuclear matrix proteins. We also analyse the role of nuclear topology in the generation of gene fusions. We speculate that this type of multi-layered analysis will one day provide a framework for a more comprehensive understanding of the genetic origins of cancer and the identification of new therapeutic targets.

AB  - Aim Plasma fibrinogen and D-dimer have been reported to predict survival in several types of malignancies. The aim of this study is to investigate their predictive value in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods We retrospectively analyzed plasma fibrinogen and D-dimer levels from 252 subjects: control (n?=?20), hepatitis (n?=?20), cirrhosis (n?=?20), and HCC (n?=?192) subjects. The clinical involvement and prognostic value of fibrinogen and D-dimer was analyzed in HCC subjects. To confirm the effects of tumor on hypercoagulability and fibrinolysis, fibrinogen and D-dimer levels were measured in nude mice following HCC inoculation. Results Fibrinogen decreased and D-dimer increased in cirrhosis subjects relative to other groups. In HCC subjects, elevated fibrinogen and D-dimer levels were significantly associated with adverse tumor features (increased size, stage, and grade) and systemic inflammation. Patients with HCC with either elevated fibrinogen or D-dimer levels had significantly higher 3-year tumor recurrence rates (65% vs. 41%, P?< 0.001 for fibrinogen; 67% vs. 40%, P?=?0.011 for D-dimer) and significantly lower 3-year overall survival rates (57% vs. 79%, P?< 0.001 for fibrinogen; 56% vs. 80%, P?=?0.001 for D-dimer). After multivariate analysis, elevated fibrinogen levels remained an independent predictor of poor prognosis in HCC patients. Finally, elevated levels of fibrinogen and D-dimer were confirmed in nude mice following tumor inoculation. Conclusion The fibrinogen and D-dimer levels, elevating after carcinogenesis, may serve as simple but effective predictors of adverse tumor profiles and outcomes in HCC.

AB  - Abstract Hepatocytes can be generated from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) using inducers such as chemical compounds and cytokines, but issues related to low differentiation efficiencies remain to be resolved. Recent work has shown that overexpression of lineage-specific transcription factors can directly cause cells phenotypic changes, including differentiation, trans-differentiation, and de-differentiation. We hypothesized that lentivirus-mediated constitutive expression of forkhead box A2 (Foxa2) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (Hnf4a) could promote inducing mouse ESCs to hepatocyte-likes cells. First, ESC lines that stably expressed Foxa2, Hnf4a, or Foxa2/Hnf4a were constructed via lentiviral expression vectors. Second, observations of cell morphology changes were made during the cell culture process, followed by experiments examining teratoma formation. Then, the effects of constitutive expression of Foxa2 and Hnf4a on hepatic differentiation and maturation were determined by measuring the marker gene expression levels of Albumin, α-fetoprotein, Cytokeratin18, and α1-antitrypsin. The results indicate that constitutive expression of Foxa2 and Hnf4a does not affect ESCs culture, teratoma formation, or the expression levels of the specific hepatocyte genes under autonomous differentiation. However, with some assistance from inducing factors, Foxa2 significantly increased the hepatic differentiation of ESCs, whereas the expression of Hnf4a alone or Foxa2/Hnf4a could not. Differentiated CCE-Foxa2 cells were more superior in expressing several liver-specific markers and protein, storing glycogen than differentiated CCE cells. Therefore, our method employing the transduction of Foxa2 would be a valuable tool for the efficient generation of functional hepatocytes derived from ESCs. J. Cell.

AB  - Objectives:? High resolution two-dimensional ultrasound (2D US) difficulty in evaluation of some scrotal mass lesions is not frequent. The aim of the present study was to prospectively evaluate the diagnostic performance of three-dimensional ultrasound extended imaging (3D XI) in characterization of those lesions. Methods:? The study protocol had the approval of the University's review board all participants' informed consents were obtained. The study included 28 selected patients (12 testicular and 16 para-testicular mass lesions) examined by 2D US and 3D XI applications including computed multi-slice view (MSV) and multi-resolution enhanced images (XI MR). Results were correlated with histopathological findings. Results:? Two-dimensional ultrasound did not adequately characterize 28 patients out of 329 (8.5%). 3D XI interrogation was an easy procedure and distinctive of the pathological findings in 27 patients out of 28 (96.4%). The performance of XI MR with respect to characterization provided additional diagnostic information over MSV. Conclusions:? The performance of 3D XI with respect to testicular mass characterization proved better than static 2D US. Subsequently, the results of this study suggest that the routine use of 2D US in diagnosis of scrotal mass lesions should preferably be upgraded to 3D XI methods.

Rates and patterns of HCC recurrences were investigated in patients undergoing DBD (N?=?1633) and DCD (N?=?243) LT between 2003 and 2012. LT for HCC was identified in 397 patients (340 DBD and 57 DCD). No difference in tumor number (p?=?0.26), tumor volume (p?=?0.34) and serum alphafetoprotein (AFP) (p?=?0.47) was seen between the groups. HCC recurrence was identified in 41 (12.1%) patients in the DBD group and 7 (12.3%) patients in the DCD group. There was no difference in recurrence-free survival (p?=?0.29) or cumulative incidence of HCC recurrence (p?=?0.91) between the groups. Liver allograft was the first site of recurrence in 22 (65%) patients in the DBD group and two (37%) patients in the DCD group (p?=?0.39). LT for HCC with DBD and DCD allografts demonstrate no difference in the rate of HCC recurrence. Previously published differences in survival demonstrated between recipients with HCC receiving DBD and DCD allografts despite statistical adjustment can likely be explained by practice patterns not captured by variables contained in the SRTR database.

AB  - Growing clinical evidence suggests critical involvement of spreading depolarizations (SDs) in the pathophysiology of neurological disorders such as migraine and stroke. MRI provides powerful tools to detect and assess co-occurring cerebral hemodynamic and cellular changes during SDs. This study reports the feasibility and advantages of two MRI scans, based on balanced steady-state free precession (b-SSFP) and diffusion-weighted multi-spin-echo (DT2), heretofore unexplored for monitoring SDs. These were compared with gradient-echo MRI. SDs were induced by KCl application in rat brain. Known for high SNR, the T2- and T1-based b-SSFP contrast was hypothesized to provide higher spatiotemporal specificity than -based gradient-echo scanning. DT2 scanning was designed to provide simultaneous T2 and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurements, thus enabling combined quantitative assessment of hemodynamic and cellular changes during SDs. Procedures were developed to automate identification of SD-induced responses in all the scans. These responses were analyzed to determine detection sensitivity and temporal characteristics of signals from each scanning method. Cluster analysis was performed to elucidate unique temporal patterns for each contrast. All scans allowed detection of SD-induced responses. b-SSFP scans showed significantly larger relative intensity changes, narrower peak widths and greater spatial specificity compared with gradient-echo MRI. SD-induced effects on ADC, calculated from DT2 scans, showed the most pronounced signal changes, displaying about 20% decrease, as against 10?15% signal increases observed with b-SSFP and gradient-echo scanning. Cluster analysis revealed additional temporal sub-patterns, such as an initial dip on gradient-echo scans and temporally shifted T2 and proton density changes in DT2 data. To summarize, b-SSFP and DT2 scanning provide distinct information on SDs compared with gradient-echo MRI. DT2 scanning, with its potential to simultaneously provide cellular and hemodynamic information, can offer unique information on the inter-relationship between these processes in pathologic brain, which may improve monitoring of spreading depolarizations in (pre)clinical settings.

AB  - Abstract Introduction Women living with HIV (WLHIV) experience stigma and elevated exposure to violence in comparison with HIV-negative women. We examined the mediating role of experiencing recent violence in the relationship between stigma and depression among WLHIV in Canada. Methods We conducted a cohort study with WLHIV in three Canadian provinces. Recent violence was assessed through self-reported experiences of control, physical, sexual or verbal abuse in the past three months. At Time 1 (2013-2015) three forms of stigma were assessed (HIV-related, racial, gender) and at Time 2 (2015-2017) only HIV-related stigma was assessed. We conducted structural equation modelling (SEM) using the maximum likelihood estimation method with Time 1 data to identify direct and indirect effects of gender discrimination, racial discrimination and HIV-related stigma on depression via recent violence. We then conducted mixed effects regression and SEM using Time 1 and Time 2 data to examine associations between HIV-related stigma, recent violence and depression. Results At Time 1 (n = 1296), the direct path from HIV-related stigma (direct effect: ? = 0.200, p < 0.001; indirect effect: ? = 0.014, p < 0.05) to depression was significant; recent violence accounted for 6.5% of the total effect. Gender discrimination had a significant direct and indirect effect on depression (direct effect: ? = 0.167, p < 0.001; indirect effect: ? = 0.050, p < 0.001); recent violence explained 23.15% of the total effect. Including Time 1 and Time 2 data (n = 1161), mixed-effects regression results indicate a positive relationship over time between HIV-related stigma and depression (Acoef: 0.04, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.06, p < 0.001), and recent violence and depression (Acoef: 1.95, 95% CI: 0.29, 4.42, p < 0.05), controlling for socio-demographics. There was a significant interaction between HIV-related stigma and recent violence with depression (Acoef: 0.04, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.07, p < 0.05). SEM analyses reveal that HIV-related stigma had a significant direct and indirect effect on depression over time (direct effect: ? = 0.178, p < 0.001; indirect effect: ? = 0.040, p < 0.001); recent violence experiences accounted for 51% of the total effect. Conclusions Our findings suggest that HIV-related stigma is associated with increased experiences of recent violence, and both stigma and violence are associated with increased depression among WLHIV in Canada. There is an urgent need for trauma-informed stigma interventions to address stigma, discrimination and violence.

AB  - Immunoassays have long been an important set of tools in clinical laboratories for the detection, diagnosis, and treatment of disease. Over the last two decades, there has been growing interest in utilizing CE as a means for conducting immunoassays with clinical samples. The resulting method is known as a CE immunoassay. This approach makes use of the selective and strong binding of antibodies for their targets, as is employed in a traditional immunoassay, and combines this with the speed, efficiency, and small sample requirements of CE. This review discusses the variety of ways in which CE immunoassays have been employed with clinical samples. An overview of the formats and detection modes that have been employed in these applications is first presented. A more detailed discussion is then given on the type of clinical targets and samples that have been measured or studied by using CE immunoassays. Particular attention is given to the use of this method in the fields of endocrinology, pharmaceutical measurements, protein and peptide analysis, immunology, infectious disease detection, and oncology. Representative applications in each of these areas are described, with these examples involving work with both traditional and microanalytical CE systems.
